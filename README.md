### Hello there
You will need the csv files attached to this repo to run the code.

### What is this task about?
This task involved taking dwelling data and graphing it so it can be easily interepered. While also creating a dashboard so you can access this information with just a few clicks.


### What you will get when you run this code
You will get the:
- Average house value per neighbourhood
- Dwelling types per year
- Most expensive neighbourhoods 
- Etc. 


### Something to note
I changed the code on the dashboard notebook to make it look pleasant to read. I however did not change the rental analysis notebook, if you are wondering why the coding is different. 

Thankyou for taking the time to look into my code and seeing how I can improve upon it.
